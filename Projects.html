      <h3>Text Encoder and Decoder using Java</h3>
      <p>Developed a Text Encoder and Decoder application in Java, implementing a shift-based cipher technique for secure message transformation. The project featured both encoding and decoding functionalities with support for uppercase, lowercase, and special characters. A user-friendly menu-driven interface was designed to handle inputs, process encryption, and reverse the cipher with ease. Emphasis was placed on modular programming by creating separate methods for each core functionality. The project also incorporated edge-case handling, such as character wrapping, ensuring accurate and reliable message processing. This strengthened my problem-solving skills and understanding of basic cryptography concepts in Java.</p>

      <h3>SecureVault – Data Leakage Prevention System</h3>
      <p>It is a Python-powered tool designed to protect sensitive data in real-time. It monitors clipboard, files, emails, and USB activities to instantly detect potential data leaks. Using regex-based detection and policy-driven controls, it ensures secure handling of confidential information. A Flask-based dashboard provides visualized reports for easy analysis of security incidents. Built with Python, Flask, Watchdog, and threading, the system combines monitoring, detection, and reporting into one seamless solution. Its modular design makes it scalable and adaptable for advanced security integrations.</p>

      <h3>Automated Vulnerability Scanner using OWASP</h3>
      <p>The Automated Vulnerability Scanning and Reporting Tool is a Python-based project that scans web applications for common security vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, XSS, and insecure configurations using OWASP ZAP. It ranks vulnerabilities by severity and provides mitigation suggestions. The tool generates PDF reports using ReportLab and offers a Flask-based dashboard for viewing scan results. Automated scheduling with Task Scheduler or cron jobs enables periodic scans. This project simplifies vulnerability assessment and strengthens web application security.</p>

      <h3>Steganography Tool</h3>
      <p>Developed a Python-based Secure Data Hiding in Images using Steganography project that enables secret message embedding in images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. The tool ensures that the hidden message remains invisible to the human eye while preserving image quality. Implemented both message encoding and decoding functionalities for secure communication. Built using Python and the Pillow library, the project demonstrates practical applications of data security and confidentiality. This solution can be extended for encryption or integrated with real-time communication systems for enhanced security.</p>

      <h3>Keylogger Using Tinker</h3>
      <p>I developed a simple Keylogger using Python and Tkinter to capture and log keystrokes for learning and demonstration purposes. The application uses event binding to record all printable keys and stores them in a text file for later analysis. It handles file operations efficiently and ignores special keys like Shift and Ctrl to keep the logs clean. The project also showcases Python GUI concepts while maintaining a lightweight and modular structure. Future improvements include adding timestamp logging and a start/stop GUI interface for better control. This project served as a hands-on way to explore event-driven programming in Python.</p>

      <h3>Secret Code Generator using Python</h3>
      <p>The Secret Code Generator is a Python-based tool that enables users to securely encode and decode messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. It features a simple command-line interface where users can input messages, apply a custom shift value, and generate secret codes instantly. The tool handles both uppercase and lowercase letters while preserving numbers, spaces, and special characters. With clear menu-driven options, it makes encryption and decryption easy for beginners. This project demonstrates my skills in Python programming, string manipulation, and building interactive console applications. Future enhancements include adding a graphical interface and supporting advanced encryption methods.</p>
